# Flourishing Fields
A Minecraft fabric mod about flowers and bees.

## Bee Behaviour
When a bee collects nectar from a flower, thereâ€™s a small chance that the same type of flower will spawn on a block the bee flies over while returning to its beehive.
## Flower Behaviour
- **Normal break:** 12.5% chance to drop 1-2 seeds *(no flower item)*
- **Shears break:** always drops the flower
- **Planting:** seeds go on any block vanilla flowers accept
- **Mature crop break:** returns seeds *(100%)*
- **Mature crop with shears:** drops seeds & flower *(100%)*
