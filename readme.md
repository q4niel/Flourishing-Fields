# Flourishing Fields
A Minecraft mod that adds a unique mechanic to your world.
Bees now have a chance to spread flowers while pollinating.
When a bee collects nectar from a flower,
thereâ€™s a small chance that the same type of flower will spawn on a block the bee flies over while returning to its beehive.
