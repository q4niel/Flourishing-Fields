# Flourishing Fields
A Minecraft fabric mod about flowers and bees.

## Features
- Bees now have a chance to spread flowers while pollinating. When a bee collects nectar from a flower, thereâ€™s a small chance that the same type of flower will spawn on a block the bee flies over while returning to its beehive.
